[Process vs Procedure: What’s the Difference? - Tallyfy](https://tallyfy.com/procedure-vs-process/)

> **A process** is a series of related tasks or methods that together turn inputs into outputs.  
> **A procedure** is a prescribed way of undertaking a process or part of a process.
> 
> At a glance, the two might seem confusing, as they both refer to the same activities being carried out. So, to make it easier, you can look at the difference between a process and a procedure as “what” versus “how.”
> 
> A process consists of three elements:
> 
> -   An input (materials or information)
> -   A process with its sub-processes
> -   An output
> 
> A procedure, on the other hand, describes:
> 
> -   Who is responsible for each part of the process
> -   When each part of the process occurs
> -   The specifications applicable to each part of the process
> 
> Considering the differences between the two terms, it shouldn’t be too surprising that there are different ways to document them. For a process, a simple [workflow diagram](https://tallyfy.com/workflow-diagram/) would do. Procedures, on the other hand, would be explained through a physical or electronic document (To complete the process, do X, Y, and Z). Unlike processes, a procedure doesn’t have to be a workflow – a set of simple guidelines could suffice.

> ## Process and Procedure Example
> 
> A fast food outlet makes hamburgers. The process is a simple one, and it all starts with taking the order. After that, the staff springs into action, cooks the patty, prepares the hamburger roll and serves the finished hamburger up to the client.
> 
> However, inside this simple process, the fast food outlet’s staff also follow several procedures. Thus, the store owner might specify that the sales assistant should greet the client and smile. He or she may even provide a script for the interaction. That’s a procedure, and it can make a huge difference to a business.
> 
> Just think of it: even if the sales assistant is rude and unfriendly, he or she has still completed a part of the hamburger-making process the minute the order is written down. Sure, the customer isn’t going to come back, but the sales assistant has still done the job. The “what” criterion has been fulfilled.
> 
> But if the person behind the counter follows a procedure that indicates the expected standard for customer interactions, the entire [customer experience](https://tallyfy.com/customer-experience/) changes. Sure, the task remains the same: the assistant writes the order. However, the customer is happy because the quality of the order-placing experience was so much better.
